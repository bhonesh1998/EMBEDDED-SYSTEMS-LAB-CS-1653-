# EMBEDDED-SYSTEMS-LAB-CS-1653-
Spectrum for this is wide enough and will cover lot of the embedded technologies lying in currently in real world. Digital system design using logic elements is one part of lab. Next will be working with microcontrollers (8051, PIC, Cortex M or ARM &amp; else). Assignments concerning design of some real time systems either with processor, controllers OR ASIC technology are added portion. Next thing covered will be FPGA with programming in HDL (VHDL or Verilog). Working with technologies will involve interfacing with real ti me environment through sensors and actuators. Intent of this will be to give real view of embedded technologies and applications leading to robotics and mechatronics.
